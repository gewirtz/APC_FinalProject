These are algos that work but need to be integated in with the class structure

Waiting on doing this bc we need to make a decision abut how we process. For both of these we need to know the # of images
so we can cycle through them. This # is different for train and test. We can do 2 things:

(1) Changes all our files to take in the data set to process so now it'll be 
Gaussian_processing::process(arma::mat &train); //Note: I am not sure this is right from a pointer/reference perspective
Gaussian_processing::process(arma::mat &test);

Instead of what we have now which just has process() 

If we do this we need to change it in the virtual class, the no processing class, and the .cc for no processing 

(2) Copy and paste the same processing code for both test and train within the process() method - this is janky 
and definitely a second string solution
