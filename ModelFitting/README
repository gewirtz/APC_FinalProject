so far, we have written bare bones versions of a linear regression model and a gradient descent optimizer.  
We have two main abstract classes- Model and Optimizer.
we need to understand desired inputs/outputs for our program and once we do so we will 
adapt out program accordingly.
we want to extend features (logistic regression, various penalties).  
By the alpha deadline, we want to have a main that properly incorporates other portions of the code, and have
tested our classes and methods to make sure they work. By the beta deadline, we want to have 2-3 other methods/optimizers 
coded and tested. 


Update 12/12: We're doing our classes and methods testing to check if they work
